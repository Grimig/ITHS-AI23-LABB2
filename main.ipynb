    "## Using synthetic data and ML to solve the problem of differentiating between obese Pichus and Pikachus\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The purpose of this lab is to utilize the tools you have learned in Python to implement a simplified machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this lab, there is simulated data on the lengths and widths of Pichus and Pikachus. Your task is to create an algorithm that can classify a new data point as either Pichu or Pikachu based on the given data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Task\n",
    "Follow this flowchart to build the basic algorithm.\n",
    "- Test Data Coordinates: `(25,32), (24.2,31.5), (22,34), (20.5,34)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "- Sample with (width, height): `(25, 32)` classified as Pikachu\n",
    "- Sample with (width, height): `(24.2, 31.5)` classified as Pikachu\n",
    "- Sample with (width, height): `(22, 34)` classified as Pikachu\n",
    "- Sample with (width, height): `(20.5, 34)` classified as Pichu\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Tasks\n",
    "Complete these tasks once you have correctly classified the test data.\n",
    "1. Allow the user to input a test point and have the algorithm determine its class.\n",
    "    - Include error handling for negative numbers and non-numeric inputs. Make sure to provide user-friendly error messages.\n",
    "2. The nearest-point approach we have used may misclassify when the points of each class overlap.\n",
    "    - Now choose the ten nearest points to your test point.\n",
    "    - The class of the test point is determined by majority voting among the nearest points.\n",
